# Code of Conduct
The [HTML PLUS]() Code of Conduct is one of the ways we put HTML PLUS’s values into practice. It’s built around the recognition that everything we do in connection with our contributing at HTMLPLUS will be, and should be, measured against the highest possible standards of ethical business conduct. We set the bar that high for practical as well as aspirational reasons: Our commitment to the highest standards helps us build great products, and attract loyal users. Respect for our users, for the opportunity, and for each other are foundational to our success, and are something we need to support every day.
